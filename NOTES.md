# AnnaSetu — SIH 2026 Prototype Technical & Demo Notes

This document provides a transparent breakdown of the AnnaSetu prototype architecture, design decisions, simulated features, script beats, and verified fixes for the 2–3 minute video presentation.

---

## 1. Prototype Overview

- **Product Name:** AnnaSetu ("Anna" = Food, "Setu" = Bridge)
- **Target Audience:** Institutional Kitchens (Hotels, College Messes, Hospital Canteens, Banquet Halls), Recipient NGOs, and Municipal Waste Regulators.
- **Built With:** React + Vite + Tailwind CSS + Lucide Icons + Recharts + Leaflet + `qrcode.react`.
- **Run Command:** `npm run dev` (starts on `http://localhost:5173`).

## 2. Simulated vs. Real Components (For Demo Presentation)

| Module / Feature | Presentation Mode | Simulation Implementation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **User Roles & Auth** | Simulated Role Picker | Switch between Kitchen, NGO, and Admin views with one click; no auth backend required. |
| **AI Demand Forecast** | Deterministic Rules Model | Recharts graph seeded with 7-day historical booking/weather dataset and live optimization recommendations. |
| **AI Freshness Scan** | Simulated Telemetry Scanner | 1.5s scanning animation overlaying visual texture scanning, thermal sensor checks, radial freshness gauge (0–100), and FSSAI 2–4 hr decay timer. |
| **NGO Geo-Matching** | Leaflet & Vector Route Map | Interactive map with markers, animated Polyline route connecting Kitchen to selected NGO, 5km search radius, and progressive pickup status timeline. |
| **Spoiled Waste Diversion** | Automated SWM Routing | Amber/red path automatically locking spoiled items from NGO matching and diverting them to Bio-CNG / BSFL processing with carbon offset calculations (`2.5 kg CO₂e/kg`). |
| **Digital Audit Trail** | Real Client-Side QR Generator | Real-time QR code rendering with `qrcode.react` (`QRCodeCanvas`), handoff data payload, downloadable PNG export, and cryptographic hash (`AS-2026-00421`). |

## 3. Demo Video Recording Script (2:30 Target Duration)

- **Beat 1 (0:00 - 0:25):** Hero Landing Page — highlight India's 78M tonne / ₹1.55L crore food waste crisis.
- **Beat 2 (0:25 - 0:50):** Kitchen Dashboard — showcase ticking ₹ Saved counter (₹28,400+) and Recharts 7-day demand forecast.
- **Beat 3 (0:50 - 1:20):** Core AI Quality Scan — log a surplus batch, run the 1.5s scanning animation, display the 94/100 freshness score and FSSAI countdown timer.
- **Beat 4 (1:20 - 1:50):** Edible Branch Geo-Matching — show Leaflet route map with `<200ms` match latency, dispatch to Sunrise Foundation, generate real FSSAI QR handoff code & download PNG.
- **Beat 5 (1:50 - 2:15):** Spoiled Branch Bio-CNG Routing — select spoiled batch preset, show SWM 2016 safety alert, route to Bio-CNG, calculate 70 kg CO₂e methane offset.
- **Beat 6 (2:15 - 2:45):** Admin Audit Ledger & SaaS ROI — review 100% cryptographic FSSAI audit table, before/after pitch deck matrix, and ₹3,000–₹5,000 SaaS pricing cards.

## 4. Key Performance Metrics Visualized

- **Demand Forecast Accuracy:** `>92%`
- **Geo-Matching Latency:** `<200ms`
- **NGO Claim Window:** `10 Minutes` (with automated auto-reroute)
- **Financial Savings:** `8x - 10x ROI` on subscription cost (₹15,000–₹30,000/month saved)
- **Environmental Impact:** `1.2 Tonnes CO₂e` methane offset per kitchen/year via Bio-CNG diversion

## 5. Final Fixes & Audit Verification

- **Route mapping:** **FIXED.** Integrated Leaflet + React Leaflet map with Kitchen marker, selected NGO marker, animated Polyline route path, distance (`4.2 km`), ETA (`12 min`), and progressive pickup status timeline (`Accepted` → `En Route` → `Delivered`).
- **QR generation:** **FIXED.** Replaced static image placeholder with real client-side QR generation using `qrcode.react` (`QRCodeCanvas`). Renders dynamic handoff JSON payloads and supports 1-click PNG image downloads.
- **Responsive mobile:** **FIXED.** Added mobile drawer navigation header, stack map and NGO lists vertically, touch targets ≥ 44px, and zero horizontal page overflow at 375px width.
- **Responsive tablet:** **FIXED.** Verified layout at 768px with 2-column KPI cards and responsive charts.
- **Responsive desktop:** **VERIFIED.** 4-column KPI grids, 12-column map split view, and expanded audit tables.
- **Build:** **PASSED.** Production build (`npm run build`) completed cleanly with 0 errors.
- **Demo flow:** **VERIFIED.** End-to-end edible and spoiled workflows tested without console errors.

### Known Limitations (By Design for Hackathon Scope)
- Geospatial routing uses deterministic mock coordinates for stable video recording without external API key dependencies.
- Auth is simulated via quick-switch persona buttons for demo speed.
